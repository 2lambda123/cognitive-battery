# Designer Files

The `/ui` directory contains `.ui` files used by QT Designer to create
the various windows and dialogs of the application. Edit those in QT Designer
if you want to make changes to the user interface.

After making changes in QT Designer, you'll need to convert the `.ui` files to
Python modules. `/ui/convertUI.bat` is a Windows batch script for converting
(using `pyuic`) the QT Designer UI files to Python modules that can be
imported by the main script.

The Python `.py` files in this directory are the modules generated by the
batch script above. These are used to set up the UI elements and window logic
elsewhere (see `../interface/`)

**Note**: Do not manually edit the `.py` files in this directory. While it
might be tempting to add/change UI elements directly in the Python file,
any changes you make will be overwritten by the `.ui -> .py` conversion
process.
