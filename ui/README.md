#QT Designer
This folder contains a QT designer file (`battery_select.ui`) for the battery load screen, as well as the compiled Python version (`battery.py`).

Feel free to use the `.ui` file in conjunction with QT designer to alter the load screen interface. After compilation, the changes in the resulting `.py` file need to be manually copied over to `battery_select.py`.

**Warning**: If you don't manually copy the contents and instead just replace `battery_select.py`, you will lose all functionality from the load screen.
