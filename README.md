#Cognitive Battery

##Description
A Python based battery of common cognitive psychology tasks. Designed to be modular as each task is contained within a single Python script, the results of which are returned as a dataframe for saving. Pull requests are welcome! Please see the contribution notes below.

Some tasks contain copyrighted images (e.g. Mental Rotations Task, Raven's Progressive Matrices) that I cannot include in this repo. In case you have access to the original images, I have included an explanation of how to name/format those items to work with this battery.

Note: I created this project as I needed to get some tasks up and running quickly for an experiment. Everything is fully functional as it stands, but I will be refactoring much of the code over time to clean things up.

##Requirements
You will need to have the following dependencies installed to run the battery:

* **Python 2.7.x**
  - The easiest way to install Python is using the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution as it also includes some of the other dependencies listed below.
* **Pandas**
  - Included with Anaconda. Otherwise, install using pip (`pip install pandas`)
* **Numpy**
  - Included with Anaconda. Otherwise, install using pip (`pip install numpy`)
* **Pygame**
  - Downloadable from the [Pygame website](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml). If you installed 64bit Python, you will need to download the 64bit Pygame binaries from [here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame) and install using pip (`pip install <pygame download>.whl`)
